Here we have main that is a few commits ahead of branches one two and three. For whatever reason, we need to update these three other branches with modified versions of the last few commits on main.

Branch one needs a re-ordering of those commits and an exclusion/drop of C5. Branch two just needs a pure reordering of the commits, and three only needs one commit transferred!

Solution:
1) git checkout one
2) git cherry-pick C4 C3 C2
3) git checkout two
4) git cherry-pick C5 C4 C3 C2
5) git branch -f three C2
